# Others
- No events
- initialAmount badly initialized in constructor

# Vars
    - Unneeded 0 initialization
    - Can add multiple times the same investors
    - Mapping should be used instead of dynamic length array for investors

# Add Investor
    - Anyone can add investors but the subject says it should be by an administrator

# Claim Tokens
    - Ditch the for loop and use a mapping for investors[msg.sender]
    - else statement in the loop is not necessary
    - payout var is never updated
    - if found we calculate the payout, but in both case we transfer the tokens

# Calculate Payout 
    - unneeded payout init to 0
    - blockReward is shadowed by the fn
    - doesn't check investor length, div by 0
    - rewards seem to increase over time, not decrease
